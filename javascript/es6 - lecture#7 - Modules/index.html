    <h2 style="text-align: center;">A background on modules</h2>

    <p>JavaScript programs started off pretty small â€” most of its usage in the early days was to do isolated scripting
        tasks, providing a bit of interactivity to your web pages where needed, so large scripts were generally not
        needed.
        Fast forward a few years and we now have complete applications being run in browsers with a lot of JavaScript,
        as
        well as JavaScript being used in other contexts (Node.js, for example).</p>

    <p>It has therefore made sense in recent years to start thinking about providing mechanisms for splitting JavaScript
        programs up into separate modules that can be imported when needed.</p>

    <p>In simple words: The idea is that you can create a JavaScript file that contains the code you want to use in your other files.</p>
